First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts\n    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are\n    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping\n    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks\n    // EtherDog ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of\n    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.\n    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!\n    //\n    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major\n    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still\n    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core\n    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus\n    //             internal functions for managing these items.\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations\n    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token\n    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed EtherDogs together, including\n    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on EtherDogs or siring\n    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one\n    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated\n    //             through this facet of the core contract.\n    //\n    //      - EtherDogMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 EtherDogs.\n    //             We can make up to 5000 \"promo\" EtherDogs that can be given away (especially important when\n    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up\n    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price. Regardless of how they\n    //             are created, there is a hard limit of 2400*12*12 gen0 EtherDogs. After that, it's all up to the\n    //             community to breed, breed, breed!\n\n    // Set in case the core contract is broken and an upgrade is required\n    address public newContractAddress;\n\n    /// @notice Creates the main EtherDogs smart contract instance.\n    function EtherDogCore() public {\n        // Starts paused.\n        paused = true;\n\n        // the creator of the contract is the initial CEO\n        ceoAddress = msg.sender;\n\n        // the creator of the contract is also the initial COO\n        cooAddress = msg.sender;\n\n        // start with the mythical EtherDog 0 - so we don't have generation-0 parent issues\n        _createEtherDog(0, 0, 0, uint256(-1), address(0));\n    }\n\n    /// @dev Used to mark the smart contract as upgraded, in case there is a serious\n    ///  breaking bug.
