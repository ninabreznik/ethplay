In order to keep our code seperated into logical sections,\n    // we've broken it up in two ways. First, we have several seperately-instantiated sibling contracts\n    // that handle auctions and our super-top-secret genetic combination algorithm. The auctions are\n    // seperate since their logic is somewhat complex and there's always a risk of subtle bugs. By keeping\n    // them in their own contracts, we can upgrade them without disrupting the main contract that tracks\n    // panda ownership. The genetic combination algorithm is kept seperate so we can open-source all of\n    // the rest of our code without making it _too_ easy for folks to figure out how the genetics work.\n    // Don't worry, I'm sure someone will reverse engineer it soon enough!\n    //\n    // Secondly, we break the core contract into multiple files using inheritence, one for each major\n    // facet of functionality of CK. This allows us to keep related code bundled together while still\n    // avoiding a single giant file with everything in it. The breakdown is as follows:\n    //\n    //      - PandaBase: This is where we define the most fundamental code shared throughout the core\n    //             functionality. This includes our main data storage, constants and data types, plus\n    //             internal functions for managing these items.\n    //\n    //      - PandaAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for operations\n    //             that can be executed only by specific roles. Namely CEO, CFO and COO.\n    //\n    //      - PandaOwnership: This provides the methods required for basic non-fungible token\n    //             transactions, following the draft ERC-721 spec (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721).\n    //\n    //      - PandaBreeding: This file contains the methods necessary to breed cats together, including\n    //             keeping track of siring offers, and relies on an external genetic combination contract.\n    //\n    //      - PandaAuctions: Here we have the public methods for auctioning or bidding on cats or siring\n    //             services. The actual auction functionality is handled in two sibling contracts (one\n    //             for sales and one for siring), while auction creation and bidding is mostly mediated\n    //             through this facet of the core contract.\n    //\n    //      - PandaMinting: This final facet contains the functionality we use for creating new gen0 cats.\n    //             the community is new), and all others can only be created and then immediately put up\n    //             for auction via an algorithmically determined starting price.
