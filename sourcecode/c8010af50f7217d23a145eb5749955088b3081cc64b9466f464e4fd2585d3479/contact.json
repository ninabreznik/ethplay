In order to keep our code separated into logical sections,\n    // we've broken it up into multiple files using inheritance. This allows us to keep related code\n    // collocated while still avoiding a single large file, which would be harder to maintain. The breakdown\n    // is as follows:\n    //\n    //      - OffersBase: This contract defines the fundamental code that the main contract uses.\n    //              This includes our main data storage, data types, events, and internal functions for\n    //              managing offers in their lifecycle.\n    //\n    //      - OffersConfig: This contract manages the various configuration values that determine the\n    //              details of the offers that get created, cancelled, overbid, expired, and fulfilled,\n    //              as well as the fee structure that the offers will be operating with.\n    //\n    //      - OffersAccessControl: This contract manages the various addresses and constraints for\n    //              operations that can be executed only by specific roles. The roles are: CEO, CFO,\n    //              COO, and LostAndFound.
