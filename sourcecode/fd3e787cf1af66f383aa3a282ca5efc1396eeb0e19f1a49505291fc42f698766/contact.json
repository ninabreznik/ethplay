       - gas price limit prevents users from having control over the order of execution\n        - gas price limit check can be skipped if the transaction comes from a trusted, whitelisted signer\n      Other potential solutions might include a commit/reveal based schemes\n    - Possibly add getters for the connector fields so that the client won't need to rely on the order in the
