A slice represents a part of a string -\n *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no\n *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify\n *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less\n *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.\n *\n *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return\n *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for\n *      instance, `s.split(\".\")` will return the text up to the first '.',\n *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.\n *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you\n *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:\n *      `s.copy().split(\".\")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since\n *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many\n *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.\n *\n *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating\n *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in\n *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second\n *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.\n *\n *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than\n *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if\n *      required.\n *\n *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying\n *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,\n *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values\n *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.\n */\n\nlibrary strings {\n    struct slice {\n        uint _len;\n        uint _ptr;\n    }\n\n    function memcpy(uint dest, uint src, uint len) private pure {\n        // Copy word-length chunks while possible\n        for(; len >= 32; len -= 32) {\n            assembly {\n                mstore(dest, mload(src))\n            }\n            dest += 32;\n            src += 32;\n        }\n\n        // Copy remaining bytes\n        uint mask = 256 ** (32 - len) - 1;\n        assembly {\n            let srcpart := and(mload(src), not(mask))\n            let destpart := and(mload(dest), mask)\n            mstore(dest, or(destpart, srcpart))\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire string.\n     * @param self The string to make a slice from.\n     * @return A newly allocated slice containing the entire string.\n     */\n    function toSlice(string memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\n        uint ptr;\n        assembly {\n            ptr := add(self, 0x20)\n        }\n        return slice(bytes(self).length, ptr);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns the length of a null-terminated bytes32 string.\n     * @param self The value to find the length of.\n     * @return The length of the string, from 0 to 32.\n     */\n    function len(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (uint) {\n        uint ret;\n        if (self == 0)\n            return 0;\n        if (self & 0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff == 0) {\n            ret += 16;\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x100000000000000000000000000000000);\n        }\n        if (self & 0xffffffffffffffff == 0) {\n            ret += 8;\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x10000000000000000);\n        }\n        if (self & 0xffffffff == 0) {\n            ret += 4;\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x100000000);\n        }\n        if (self & 0xffff == 0) {\n            ret += 2;\n            self = bytes32(uint(self) / 0x10000);\n        }\n        if (self & 0xff == 0) {\n            ret += 1;\n        }\n        return 32 - ret;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire bytes32, interpreted as a\n     *      null-terminated utf-8 string.\n     * @param self The bytes32 value to convert to a slice.\n     * @return A new slice containing the value of the input argument up to the\n     *         first null.\n     */\n    function toSliceB32(bytes32 self) internal pure returns (slice memory ret) {\n        // Allocate space for `self` in memory, copy it there, and point ret at it\n        assembly {\n            let ptr := mload(0x40)\n            mstore(0x40, add(ptr, 0x20))\n            mstore(ptr, self)\n            mstore(add(ret, 0x20), ptr)\n        }\n        ret._len = len(self);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns a new slice containing the same data as the current slice.\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\n     * @return A new slice containing the same data as `self`.\n     */\n    function copy(slice memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\n        return slice(self._len, self._ptr);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Copies a slice to a new string.\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\n     * @return A newly allocated string containing the slice's text.\n     */\n    function toString(slice memory self) internal pure returns (string memory) {\n        string memory ret = new string(self._len);\n        uint retptr;\n        assembly { retptr := add(ret, 32) }\n\n        memcpy(retptr, self._ptr, self._len);\n        return ret;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns the length in runes of the slice.
